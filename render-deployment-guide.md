# ScanSmart Render Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy both frontend and backend of your ScanSmart application on Render.com.

## Why Render?

Render is ideal for full-stack applications like ScanSmart because:
1. It supports Node.js backend services
2. It has a generous free tier
3. It's easier to set up compared to Vercel for full-stack apps
4. It doesn't require as many configuration tweaks

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. Download your project from Replit by clicking on the three dots menu at the top of the file explorer and selecting "Download as zip"

2. Extract the zip file to your local computer

3. Create a new `render.yaml` file in the root directory:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: scansmart
    env: node
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npm run start
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
```

## Step 2: Set Up a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize your local directory as a Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy on Render

1. Sign up or log in to Render (https://render.com)
2. Click "New" > "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
4. Configure the service:
   - Name: scansmart (or your preferred name)
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm run start`
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
5. Click "Create Web Service"

## What Will Happen

1. Render will clone your repository
2. It will run the build command to build both the frontend and backend
3. It will start your Express server, which will serve both the API and the static frontend files
4. You'll get a URL like `https://scansmart.onrender.com` where your app is accessible

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the Render logs for specific error messages
2. Make sure your package.json scripts are correctly set up for building and starting the app
3. If you're still having problems, try using a `Dockerfile` deployment method instead

## Using a Custom Domain

1. In the Render dashboard, go to your web service
2. Click on "Settings" > "Custom Domain"
3. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domain

## The Benefits

- Your entire application (frontend and backend) will be deployed as a single unit
- No need to worry about CORS or API endpoints across different domains
- Built-in continuous deployment will automatically update your app when you push to GitHub
- Free tier includes SSL certificates and a decent amount of bandwidth

## Maintenance and Updates

1. Make changes to your code locally
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render will automatically rebuild and deploy your application
